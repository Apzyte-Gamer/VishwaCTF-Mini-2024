Dear Detective,

I hope this letter reaches you well. I'm reaching out because something serious has happened â€“ 
a prominent person has been murdered,and I know who did it. 

However, I'm afraid to write the name directly, as this letter could end up in the wrong hands.
I believe in your sharp detective skills, so I'm relying on you to carefully examine the envelope and decode the hidden message.

Your reputation for solving mysteries precedes you, and I trust you can handle this with the discretion it requires.

Best regards,

A Concerned Observer
